## Day 6

- Set up Git locally and connected the project to GitHub
- Learned the difference between local repo and remote repo
- Understood why main/master branches exist and how to fix branch issues
- Successfully pushed the project using git commands instead of copy-paste

Feeling: Git was confusing at first, but once it clicked, it finally made sense and feels much cleaner.
